      <h5>STRATEGICALLY DESIGNED FOR ARCTIC POLAR BEARS</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>This expansive exhibit is strategically designed for Arctic polar bears, a carnivorous species threatened in the wild due to human impacts such as climate change, which rapidly melts sea ice. Polar bearsâ€™ adaptations to the Arctic environment make them dependent on the sea ice for survival, thus creating the need to conserve this species. Walter Family Arctic Tundra can support a breeding pair and their potential cubs. Equipped with naturalistic features, from ice caves to rolling terrain to cool pools, the exhibit evokes the northern reaches where polar bears prowl in search of prey.</p>
